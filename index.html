  <h1>Adoptable Pets</h1>

  <div class="one">
    <h1>Locust</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog1.jpg" alt="locust the dog">
    <p>Locust is a very loving, high energy, giant goofball that is in need of a good home with the time and energy to keep up with him. He has scars on his feet and legs from abuse his original owners inflicted on him. Though he wants nothing but to find his forever home and to love someone unconditionally. I can no longer have him due to housing situations. Despite everything Locust has been through, he is still a happy man who is always wanting to play. One of the things to know about him is that he is very anxious when it comes to being inside vehicles due to the abuse he encountered but he warms up fast. He is not aggressive towards cats but he is very curious and wants to play with them so he tends to chase them. He likes cats but cats don't necessarily like him. Locust knows some pretty basic tricks such as sit, down, and shake. He is still working on not jumping on you but he just can't help it because he is so excited that you're home. With a little work he will get better.</p>

    <h1>Tuck</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog2.jpg" alt="tuck the dog">
    <p>It absolutely breaks our hearts to have to rehome our baby. Tuck has been with us a little over two years now and unfortunately has developed aggressive tendencies towards my husband that behaviorists cannot explain or help us curb. He is one of the sweetest dogs I’ve ever met! When we adopted him from the humane society we were told he is not a cuddler, he definitely proved them wrong. He is four years old and according to our vet healthy aside from being over weight. Tuck would benefit from being adopted by an experienced old couple, no other pets and no children. He’s very high energy and needs space to play. He knows basic commands, sit, stay, shake, lie down. He pulls on the leash, but we were working on it. He’s stubborn, but sweet, loving, very playful, isn’t a big fan of chicken, loves salmon. I could go on and on, he is my whole heart and if you choose to take him into your home I know you will not regret calling him your baby boy.</p>

  <div class="three">
    <h1>Panda</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog3.jpg" alt="panda the dog">
    <p>Fantastic guy, super friendly and outgoing, great with other dogs and doing super well on house and crate training. Panda is a medium speed dog so he does not require marathon walking...lol. He is a great one to take to the dog park as he loves strolling around and meeting all kinds of new people and other pets. He has a great personality and loves to smile at you.</p>
