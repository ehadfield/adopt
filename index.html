  <h1>Adoptable Pets</h1>

  <div class="one">
    <h1>Locust</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog1.jpg" alt="locust the dog">
    <p>Locust is a very loving, high energy, giant goofball that is in need of a good home with the time and energy to keep up with him. He has scars on his feet and legs from abuse his original owners inflicted on him. Though he wants nothing but to find his forever home and to love someone unconditionally. I can no longer have him due to housing situations. Despite everything Locust has been through, he is still a happy man who is always wanting to play. </p>

  <div class="two">
    <h1>Tuck</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog2.jpg" alt="tuck the dog">
    <p>It absolutely breaks our hearts to have to rehome our baby. Tuck has been with us a little over two years now and unfortunately has developed aggressive tendencies towards my husband that behaviorists cannot explain or help us curb. He is one of the sweetest dogs Iâ€™ve ever met! When we adopted him from the humane society we were told he is not a cuddler, he definitely proved them wrong. He is four years old and according to our vet healthy aside from being over weight.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="three">
    <h1>Panda</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog3.jpg" alt="panda the dog">
    <p>Fantastic guy, super friendly and outgoing, great with other dogs and doing super well on house and crate training. Panda is a medium speed dog so he does not require marathon walking...lol. He is a great one to take to the dog park as he loves strolling around and meeting all kinds of new people and other pets. He has a great personality and loves to smile at you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="four">
    <h1>Dami</h1>
    <img src="imgs/dog4.jpg" alt="dami the dog" width="250">
    <p>Dami is a super active and very very attentive girl! She watches you constantly for direction and is at your side all day long. She loves to be active, hiking, swimming, jogging and lots of dog park action as she loves to play with other dogs.</p>
